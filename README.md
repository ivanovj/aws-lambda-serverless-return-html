# aws-lambda-serverless-return-html
Return HTML page from AWS Lambda function

This is an example how to return HTML straight from an AWS Lambda function. Yes, that is perfectly possible and fairly easy to setup. 
I am utizing the Serverless framework. Configuration is in serverless.yml. The function code is in handler.js

Happy coding
