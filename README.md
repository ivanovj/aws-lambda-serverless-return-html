Return an HTML page from AWS Lambda function

This is an example how to return an HTML code/page straight from an AWS Lambda function. Yes, that is perfectly possible and fairly easy to setup. 

I am utizing the Serverless framework. Configuration is in serverless.yml. The function code is in handler.js

Happy coding
